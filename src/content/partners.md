# Partner Teams

Partner Teams are FIRST teams that work with us in our mission. Partners represent us online and at competitions, distribute promotional material, and educate students. Partners operate on three tiers of involvement:

**Bronze Tier Partners** represent us and promote us online and includes key marketing points on their website or within their web presence.

**Silver Tier Partners** represent us at all competitions they attend, distribute promotional material, and promote us online. These teams are model communities of Neurodiversity.

**Gold Tier Partners** are nominated by the administrative team and approved by the staff team. Gold Tier Partners are teams that are prepared to grow with us and continue a lasting partnership.

Interested Teams can apply [here](https://forms.gle/FbY53eHkXnetggnT9) after reviewing our Partner Team Code of Conduct [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWk46fI8z8_ijh7wGt5_YX-BwTmLeEU1Zz8VwiAl2Kg/edit?usp=sharing). Our guidelines for being an NDoF Partner Team of any tier is as follows:

- Use our marketing materials and marketing points when advocating for NDoF

  - These materials have been specially designed based on the feedback of other partner teams and staff and are designed to make an inclusive experience for everyone. If you have any feedback on the marketing materials, please let an admin know.

  - Note: Please do not modify marketing materials without the explicit permission of the NDoF Admin Team

- Help us out where you can.

  - We ask that partner teams represent us in some way, whether that be via social media, spoken-shoutout, a poster in your buildroom/shop, a logo on your robot, a banner in your pit, or any of the various ways there is to spread our name and mission. We do not require that a team represents us physically (at competitions or otherwise), but we do ask that you help us by representing us in some way.

- Let us know how we can help you out.

  - The NDoF staff team are available to answer questions about the org, its processes, or its motives. We are willing to, within reason and on request, produce materials to help you achieve NDoF’s mission.
