# Advisors
Advisors are adult staff and some of the most trusted people in the org, having put up several years of service and dedicated much of their time. They will not only advise the admin team on issues presented to them but help with anything that requires more careful work.

I’m Tessa, Alumna of FRC Team 1002. I’m a technical volunteer in FRC and FTC in the Chicago region, and a member of the FRC Midwest Regional Planning Committee. I major in Computer Science at Illinois Tech and you can often find me outside of class exploring transit systems around Chicago, tinkering with computers, volunteering at FIRST events, or playing video games. I’ve been an NDoF Representative since December 2022 and run an advocacy group called NeurodiversIIT at my university.

Hey! I'm Eva, the founder of NDoF. I served as an admin for two years, and currently serve as an advisor. I'm an outreach/initiatives mentor on FRC Team 498, and volunteer as a game announcer/emcee in FLL, FTC, and FRC. Outside of that, I currently work as a construction engineer in Arizona. In my free time, I enjoy writing, hiking, watching college football, and reading.​
