# Advisors

Advisors are adult staff and some of the most trusted people in the org, having put up several years of service and dedicated much of their time. They will not only advise the admin team on issues presented to them but help with anything that requires more careful work.

## Eva True - FRC 10506 Mentor - Autism - They/Them

Hey! I'm Eva, the founder of NDoF. I served as an admin for two years, and currently serve as an advisor. I'm the outreach/awards mentor on FRC Team 10506, and volunteer as a game announcer/emcee in FTC and FRC. Outside of that, I currently work as a construction engineer in Arizona. In my free time, I enjoy writing, hiking, watching college football, and reading.
