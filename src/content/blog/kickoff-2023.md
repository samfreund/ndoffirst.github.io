Once again, no water game :(

Seriously though, happy kickoff! As we come back into build season, we’d like to remind teams that this is a stressful time for everyone, and while supporting your robot, we also need to be supporting our neurodivergent team members in accepting them, providing quiet spaces, and otherwise accommodating them. We, and I’m sure your team members, thank you for helping them as we get deep into build season.

I’d also like to remind teams that partner team applications are open and available! We’d love to have you representing our cause. For more info, click the Partner tab on our website.

In closing, be supportive, be a gracious professional, and apply for partner!

P.S. If you aren’t a team and still want to represent our cause, apply for Representative! Take a look at the staff page on our website for more info!

Happy kickoff, folks!
