April, as many have known it, is "Autism Awareness Month". Over the course of the month, people proudly flock to social media, donate to Autism Speaks and other organizations, and sport the color blue in an outpour of questionable support. It may seem so virtuous and positive that nobody dares ask what the festivities really imply.

The truth is that I, along with many other autistic people, outwardly reject the idea of "awareness" that's been fostered by this tradition. For many of us, it's a month of misunderstandings, ableism, and sometimes outright hatred. It's a month of talk about how "unfortunate" we are. How we compare to everyone else. How we need to be "cured". All of the voices have one thing in common: they aren't autistic.

Fortunately, many have come out in direct opposition to the spirit of this month in recent years. Their protest is best marked by their signature color, red, which symbolizes the contrast between their ideals and those who support blue imagery. Red promotes acceptance instead of awareness. Acceptance to us is the idea that we can be ourselves around people, and be appreciated for who we are; to be treated as equals. Here are some staff member's ideas of acceptance.

Luc from FRC team 5925:

> "Acceptance feels like being treated like I’m everyone else even if how I behave because of my autism may not be what everyone likes to see."

Rachel from FRC team 4419:

> "To me, acceptance means loving your whole identity, not just one part of it."

Hence came the idea of "Autism Acceptance Month". We at NoF are a proud part of the movement to reclaim this month, and make it something positive. It may seem difficult, as those we are against have millions of dollars and resources. They introduce and lobby for legislation that harms and silences us. It's enough for one to look upon the situation and despair.

However, they can't stay strong forever. There's a quote from Charlie Chaplin that I've kept in mind throughout this month.

> "Do not despair, the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed; the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress."

The sentiment, while initially referring to the rise of dictators in the mid-20th century, is that hatred, greed, and injustice will pass. Terrible organizations such as Autism Speaks or the Judge Rotenberg Center will eventually be lost to time and we will still be here as the world grows more and more accepting of us. They have money; we have time. Activism doesn't bring instant change, it progresses little by little. It could be years, decades, even, before we become truly equal and accepted around the globe, but we can start now.

Instead of supporting Autism Speaks, try these instead:
