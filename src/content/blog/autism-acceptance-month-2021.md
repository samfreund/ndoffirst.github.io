As much as I’d like to say April is “just the month after March”, in the 1970’s, some thought it nice to give some of us Neurodivergent folk a whole month; Autism Awareness Month. However, as many of us have experienced, we can hardly call it “our” month. Infuriating, mentally taxing, and stressful are probably the words going through your head right now, but today we’re going to get through this month together.

It isn’t easy swimming up against years of propaganda and misinformation, but education is an important step in improving the quality of life of ourselves and our peers. Take a friend or a family member, for example, and strike up a conversation. I’ve listed some important definitions and ideas; my challenge to you is to try to touch on some of these topics and teach them something new:

- **Define Neurodivergence:** Neurodivergence is taken to be the diversity of human cognition, social behavior, and mental abilities of our peers. The term envelops the broad diversity of the human mind that has yet to be fully researched, but examples include Autism/ASD, Asperger's, Down Syndrome, ADD/ADHD, and others.

- **Define Slurs, Establish Alternatives:** “Neurodivergent” and medical diagnosis terms are all acceptable vocabulary. “Different”, “Special”, or even less savory slurs are demoralizing and should be avoided.

- **Establish Symbols of Support:** The rainbow infinity symbol is accepted to be the most representative and positive symbol for the Neurodivergent community. The puzzle piece and blue ribbon symbols have negative connotations and are to be avoided.

- **Define Triggers:** Triggers are topics, phrases, images, or sounds that inflict trauma or discomfort to an individual. Triggers are unique to every individual and can be developed at any stage of life. Triggers should be respected where boundaries are set. It is important to establish those boundaries to avoid inflicting trauma on your peers.

- **Avoid Buzzwords:** “OCD”, “ADD”, and “Autistic” are common buzzwords that are used without basis to gain attention to oneself or insult another. These terms should not be used where they aren’t appropriate; doing so diminishes the term’s meaning and is disrespectful to those communities.

However, not everyone can be an activist, and even activists need breaks. April is a stressful time for us, but together, let’s go through some ways we can come to our center and get through this month:

- **Take up your Special Interests:** If a special interest is what takes you out of a bad mindset and helps you relax, by all means go for it. There is no shame in hyperfixating on something that makes you happy; do what works for you and take some you-time.

- **Practice Mindfulness Techniques:** There has been significant research and development of mindfulness techniques and there is no shortage of resources online to guide you through them. Start by looking into specific strategies for Neurodivergent folk and find what strategies keep you most centered and healthy.

- **Find Support Groups:** Establish a trusted network of like-minded peers who can support you in times of need and you feel comfortable venting to. These can be workplace, schoolplace, or online mediums where you find the most support.

- **Seek Solace, When Needed:** On the flip side, sometimes all you need is peace and quiet. This month is exhausting; take a break and catch your breath, you’ve earned it.

April isn’t going to change on the dime and you don’t need to feel obligated to be the one to change it. This is about improving the quality of your life either through proactive action or self care. I’m rooting for you all and I hope you have an enlightening and fulfilling April!
