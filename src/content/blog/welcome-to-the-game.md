Week Zero just passed! Congratulations to teams 1729, 4909, and 1073 for winning the official Week Zero event! As teams are going to be competing at competitions in the near future remember to ask if there's a quiet space, our mission is for that information to be announced and available at every competition but that is a goal not yet reached. For everyone sensitive to change make sure you familiarize yourself with the new bracket final system. Remember not to push yourself and to drink plenty of water. We all at Neurodivergent of FIRST wish you luck and a safe environment at your events!
