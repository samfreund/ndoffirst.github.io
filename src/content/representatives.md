## Addison - FTC 3540- ADHD- She/Her

TODO
Hi everyone! I'm Addison, captain of 3540 Roboboogie! I am currently a senior in high school and I've been part of Roboboogie for the past four years and captain for the past two. I love working on the mechanical aspects of our robot and take special pride in the unique ways that our team designs and builds our robot. I plan on majoring in English Literature in college but intend on still participating in robotics and coming back to mentor my team and any other team that would like my help. This is my first year as a representative of Neurodivergent of FIRST and I can't wait to help share NDof within the FIRST community.

## Nyx - FRC 100 Alum - ADHD - They/Them

I’m Nyx, a mechanical engineer who spends probably too much time working on mechanical design projects, especially those focused on less traditional methods of creation such as CNC and additive manufacturing. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, cross-country skiing, roller/ice skating, and learning new skills. I’ve been a NDoF representative since Dec 24, 2023.

Hey everyone! I'm Seth, the programming lead for FRC 3324 The Metrobots! I'm currently a senior in high school, and I've been on the Metrobots for all four years. I excel in programming in several languages (the list goes C, C++, C#, Java, Python, and x86 assembly), and I plan to major in cybersecurity in college. I love to take on cybersecurity CTF challenges during my free time, as well as both play and develop video games.

TODO
I am Zara and I’m currently on FRC team 8177, Vector (oh yeah) and am a senior in high school. I am the safety captain and electrical/programming lead of my team. Some of my hobbies include coding, working on electrical projects, playing piano, and reading. I have been an NDoF representative since 2023. I mostly help with promoting NDoF at competitions and I spread awareness about neurodiversity within my team because I want to make robotics more accessible for neurodivergent folk.

## Zoe - FRC 4039 - ASD, ADHD - She/Her

TODO
Hey hey! The name is Zoe! I am a 5-year veteran student on FRC Team 4039, located in ON, Canada. I've been part of FIRST since 2016 with FLL, and joined the FRC scene in the 2019-20 season. On the team, I run the new NDoF Sub-Team Lead, where we focus on spreading the message of this organization and construct a mobile quiet room for the Ontario Events. I am also in charge of the team's graphical design, which heavily focuses on the artistic side of things. I've been an NDoF Representative since October 2023, and I plan on doing anything I can to help this organization achieve its goal!
