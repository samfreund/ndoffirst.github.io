## Jeanelle-FRC 1967-ADHD-Any/All

Hello there! I’m Jeanelle from team 1967, “The Janksters”. I’m currently involved in electrical, some outreach initiatives, and I occasionally dabble in some strategy. I am currently a sophomore and I joined the NDoF team in late 2025. I care a lot for people and for this organization, the people here are amazing and I want to provide the same support I feel to as many individuals as I can.

## Raven - FRC 9180 - Undiagnosed ASD - They/He

Hiya! I'm Raven! I am a member of FRC team 9180, "Ursa Major Robotics." I am one of the rare robotics kid to truthfully say they prefer non-STEM subjects. As of right now, I am in 10th grade and apprenticing to take over as design lead. I also do a lot of work on 9180's admin side of things. One of the most important things to me is helping others. In a world where we are taught vulnerability is a weakness, I see it as one of my greatest strengths. In the future, I hope to use my love of writing and humanities, along with my skills from robotics to make the world a better place— one step at a time.
