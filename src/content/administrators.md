## Raven - FRC 9180 - Undiagnosed ASD - They/He

Hiya! I'm Raven! I am a member of FRC team 9180, "Ursa Major Robotics." I am one of the rare robotics kid to truthfully say they prefer non-STEM subjects. As of right now, I am in 10th grade and apprenticing to take over as design lead. I also do a lot of work on 9180's admin side of things. One of the most important things to me is helping others. In a world where we are taught vulnerability is a weakness, I see it as one of my greatest strengths. In the future, I hope to use my love of writing and humanities, along with my skills from robotics to make the world a better place— one step at a time.
